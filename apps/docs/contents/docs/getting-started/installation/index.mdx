Setting up NoahDocs is straightforward, with options to clone the repository or use the convenient `npx` command. NoahDocs requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 18 or higher for optimal performance.

## Clone Repository

To get started, you can clone the NoahDocs repository directly from GitHub.

    ```

  </StepperItem>

  <StepperItem title="Step 4: Launch the Development Server">

## Quick Setup with npx

For a faster setup, use the `npx` command to create a new NoahDocs project in one step:

```plaintext
npx create-aria-doc <project-directory>
```

**Command Output:**

```plaintext

Next steps:
1. Navigate to your project directory:
   cd <project-directory>
2. Install dependencies:
   npm install
3. Start the development server:
   npm run dev
```

With this setup, youâ€™ll have a ready-to-use NoahDocs instance to start building your documentation.
