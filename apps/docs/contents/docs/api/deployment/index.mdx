# API Deployment

Noah Template's API is designed to be deployed to [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/), a serverless platform that offers global distribution, high performance, and low latency.

## Deployment Prerequisites

Before deploying, ensure you have:

1. A [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up)
2. The [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/) installed and authenticated
3. Your environment variables configured properly
4. A PostgreSQL database (like [Neon](https://neon.tech/)) accessible from Cloudflare Workers

## Deployment Configuration

The API uses Wrangler for deployment, with separate configuration files for different environments:

### Main Configuration (wrangler.jsonc)

```jsonc
{
  "name": "api",
  "main": "src/index.ts",
  "compatibility_date": "2025-03-08",
  "compatibility_flags": ["nodejs_compat"],
  "dev": {
    "envPath": ".env"
  },
  "vars": {
    "NODE_ENV": "development"
  }
}
```

### Staging Configuration (wrangler.staging.jsonc)

```jsonc
{
  "name": "api-staging",
  "main": "src/index.ts",
  "compatibility_date": "2025-03-08",
  "compatibility_flags": ["nodejs_compat"],
  "vars": {
    "NODE_ENV": "staging"
  }
}
```

### Production Configuration (wrangler.production.jsonc)

```jsonc
{
  "name": "api-production",
  "main": "src/index.ts",
  "compatibility_date": "2025-03-08",
  "compatibility_flags": ["nodejs_compat"],
  "vars": {
    "NODE_ENV": "production"
  }
}
```

## Setting Up Secrets

Before deployment, set up your secrets in Cloudflare:

```bash
# For staging environment
wrangler secret put DATABASE_URL --env staging
wrangler secret put BETTER_AUTH_SECRET --env staging

# For production environment
wrangler secret put DATABASE_URL --env production
wrangler secret put BETTER_AUTH_SECRET --env production
```

<Note title="Security">
  Never include sensitive information like database credentials or API keys in
  your wrangler.jsonc files or source code.
</Note>

## Deployment Commands

The API provides convenient npm scripts for deployment:

```bash
# Deploy to staging
pnpm deploy:staging

# Deploy to production
pnpm deploy:prod
```

Or you can use Wrangler directly:

```bash
# Staging deployment
wrangler deploy --env staging

# Production deployment
wrangler deploy --env production
```

## Deployment Process

When you run a deployment command:

1. The code is built and bundled by Wrangler
2. TypeScript is transpiled to JavaScript
3. The bundle is uploaded to Cloudflare
4. The Worker is deployed globally to Cloudflare's network
5. Environment variables and secrets are injected into the environment

## Custom Domains

To use a custom domain with your API:

1. Add your domain to Cloudflare (if not already there)
2. Create a Worker Route in the Cloudflare dashboard:
   - Go to **Workers & Pages** → **Your Worker** → **Triggers** → **Add Custom Domain**
   - Enter your domain (e.g., `api.yourdomain.com`)
   - Save the changes

## CORS Configuration

When deploying, update your CORS configuration to include your production domains:

```typescript
app.use(
  "*",
  cors({
    origin: [
      "https://yourdomain.com",
      "https://www.yourdomain.com",
      "https://staging.yourdomain.com",
    ],
    // ... other CORS settings
  })
);
```

Or use the `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable to manage this dynamically.

## Environment-Specific Settings

The `serverEnv` object from `@repo/env` automatically adjusts settings based on the environment:

```typescript
import { serverEnv } from "@repo/env";

// Cookies are secure in production
const cookieOptions = {
  secure: serverEnv.environment.isProduction,
  sameSite: "lax",
  // ...
};
```

## Database Considerations

For production deployments:

1. **Connection Pooling**: Use connection pooling for your PostgreSQL database
2. **Serverless-Friendly Database**: Use a service like Neon, Supabase, or Planetscale
3. **Connection String**: Update your `DATABASE_URL` with the production connection string

## Monitoring and Logs

Cloudflare provides tools for monitoring your deployed Workers:

1. **Metrics Dashboard**: Access metrics from the Cloudflare dashboard
2. **Logs**: View logs in the dashboard or via Wrangler
3. **Alerts**: Set up alerts for errors or performance issues

To view logs:

```bash
# Stream logs from the deployed Worker
wrangler tail --env production
```

## Rollbacks

If you need to roll back to a previous version:

1. Go to the Cloudflare dashboard
2. Navigate to **Workers & Pages** → **Your Worker** → **Deployments**
3. Find the version you want to roll back to
4. Click **Rollback to this version**

## Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] Test all API endpoints locally
- [ ] Set all required environment variables and secrets
- [ ] Configure CORS for production domains
- [ ] Ensure database connection settings are correct
- [ ] Verify authentication and security settings
- [ ] Test the API with the production web frontend

## Troubleshooting Deployments

If you encounter issues:

- **Deployment Errors**: Check Wrangler output for errors
- **Runtime Errors**: Check the Cloudflare dashboard logs
- **Missing Secrets**: Ensure all secrets are properly set
- **Database Connection**: Verify the database is accessible from Cloudflare
- **CORS Issues**: Check your CORS configuration and allowed origins
