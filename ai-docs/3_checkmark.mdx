# Checkmark

We need to implement a checkmark for the todo list.

## Step 1: Add a checkmark to the todo list

Create an endpoint (or maybe we have one?) to update the todo item.

mark is as completed.

## Step 2: Add a checkmark to the todo list

add a shadcn UI checkbox to the todo item from our UI package.

make it use a server action and our established data access layer with api route handlers to do it to our external API.
